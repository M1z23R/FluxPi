All scripts are made by FLUXION team and only edited by me to suit my needs.

Future:
Everything will be combined in one script.
Terminal UI
Generic Page Languages
Custom Pages

Script's main use is to be able to use something like fluxion in a single terminal without the need of X desktop.
It only creates fake captive portal like access point for evil-twin attack, it doesn't deauth anyone.
It was made for raspberry pi so in order to get it fully working you would need one interface for the AP (script) and another one with monitor mode for deauthing.
It has only one language (Serbian) so far but you can easily modify the webpages to any language.
If you wish to modify the webpages you can use following strings that will automatically change:

	%%SSID%%
  %%CHANNEL%%
  %%MAC%%


How to use:
1. Run install.sh
2. Run script with following argumenst:
-m Mac address of the fake AP
-e ESSID of fake AP
-c Channel of fake AP
-h Path to verified handshake file
-i Interface to use for fake AP

I am new to github and don't really understand how copyrights work.
